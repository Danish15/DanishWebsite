        <p class="hvr-hang"> After many years of procrastination, I have finally decided to learn front-end web development. I'm learning the content from a variety of websites such as code academy, udacity, code school, and plural sign. In addition to these websites, Youtube and Google have been a great resources.</p>
        <p class="hvr-hang"> Creating a personal website is something that has interested me. There are many great companies that offer an easy to make websites and blogs services, but I want to create a website to learn front-end web development.</p>
        <p class="hvr-hang"> My website will not be the most visually appealing website you have ever seen, but I will continue to work on it over time. Hopefully a year from now I can look back and be proud of how far I have come.</p>
        <p class="hvr-hang">I'm now one month into my goal of learning front-end web development. Picking up html and css has been easy. JavaScript is taking more time to learn but it isn't overly difficult. I have also been learning jQuery, which isn't a stand alone language, but a library of JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="hvr-hang"> I'm slowly making progress but I still haven't started building a personal website. This entry was written using Word and will be added to the website once it is up and running.</p>
        <p class="hvr-hang"> My plan is to use free resources online (Code Academy) to gain a better understanding of front-end web development. Once I have a baseline of knowledge I will enroll in a Udacity nanodegree program.</p>
